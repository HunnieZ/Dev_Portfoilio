        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a dedicated junior developer with a strong foundation in Information Technology and a passion for building innovative solutions. Holding a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, I have honed my skills in various aspects of computing, preparing me for the dynamic field of software development.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my journey to enhance my expertise and stay updated with the latest technologies, I recently completed a rigorous 12-week software development bootcamp. This intensive program allowed me to refresh my skills and dive deep into modern development practices. Throughout the bootcamp, I immersed myself in a comprehensive curriculum, mastering languages and tools crucial for today's software landscape.
        <br>
        <br>
        During the bootcamp, I delved into the core technologies of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling me to craft engaging and responsive user interfaces.
        Additionally, I explored the realm of backend development, acquiring proficiency in Python and SQL. This hands-on experience empowered me to architect robust server-side solutions and manage relational databases effectively.
        <br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, I gained practical experience working with prominent database systems such as MySQL and MongoDB. Leveraging these platforms, I developed a solid understanding of database design, optimization, and maintenance, crucial for building scalable and efficient applications.
        <br> 
        <br>
        With a blend of theoretical knowledge from my academic background and practical skills acquired through real-world projects and hands-on training, I am poised to contribute effectively to software development endeavors. Eager to embark on challenging projects and collaborate with like-minded professionals, I am committed to continuously expanding my skill set and delivering high-quality solutions that make a positive impact.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to exploring potential opportunities together.</p>

                <h3>Website Clone Project</h3>
                <p>The task was to replicate a landing page of a website. This was non functional to consolidate knowledge of html and CSS. This website is not responsive in that it does not utilise media queries for responsive design.
                <br> 
                A folder contains screengrabs of the original website page.

                <p>First simple project utilising html, CSS and JavaScript. The 'home' page pulls from an array of simple primary colours defined by name, where as the 'hex' page pulls from an array of characters which combined make up the hex colour profiles. This is a responsive site</p>

                <h3> Retro Rock Paper Scissors game</h3>
                <p>This is a more complex retro themed Rock, Paper, Scissors game utilising HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functionality. The idea is to generate a random number which equates to the computer output, which in turn makes a 'choice'. This is compared against the player's selection and ultimately leads to a win, lose or draw final score. Inspired by freecodecamp. This is also a responsive site.</p>
